The ‘flag’ is a reference to the anime series The Tower of Druaga, where it is a common foreshadowing trope that any character who claims they ‘will go home to get married after this battle’ inevitably ends up dead. So if you tell your friends you’re going on a diet, but end up eating ice cream in front of the telly, that’s a ‘raised flag’.", "", ""],
  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "daai luk mou", "You won’t ever catch a Chinese man wearing green-coloured hats or caps, because this symbolises that your significant other is cheating on you! Notably, it applies to men with unfaithful wives or girlfriends; you’d rarely say a girl is ‘wearing a green hat’. If you’re the one who cheated on your man, you can also say you’re ‘giving them a green hat to wear’.", "", ""],
  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "ngaam aa", "Though this Cantonese phrase is regularly used to show agreement, Gen Z have recently co-opted it and given it a condescending twist. If you’re ever speaking to someone annoying but can’t be bothered to refute them, simply do what the kids do and deadpan ‘That’s right’ to everything. While on the surface you’re agreeing, this phrase shows innate disapproval by being patronising.", "", ""],
  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "wui seoi", "To ‘return water’ means to refund money to a customer. In Cantonese slang, the word ‘water’ can have several meanings, but in this application it is used to reference money – $100 is colloquially referred to as ‘one clump of water’ (yaat gau shui; 一嚿水). To ‘return water’ therefore also often signifies a certain level of dissatisfaction with services, products, or performance.", "", ""],
  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "fai seoi", "Originating from Macau, ‘waste water’ refers to Taiwanese-style sugary drinks that are high in calories and not much else, such as bubble teas, black sugar milk teas, or fruit teas that so often line our streets. The implication is obviously that these drinks are just rubbish for our health – even if they taste good. Another similar slang term for these drinks is ‘fatty water’ (fei jai seui; 肥仔水).", "", ""],
  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "gam gin fan", "Originating from online forums where people post about their relationship problems and ask for advice, this phrase is short for ‘When it comes to romance, my recommendation is always to split up’ (關於感情的問題，我一律建議分手). This pessimistic view on relationships stems from the tendency of forum participants to disregard advice even after engaging in lengthy, heated debates. Frustrated netizens now commonly comment ‘Romance Recc Split’ on posts related to romance.", "", ""],
  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "saau pei", "To be used with some caution, telling someone to ‘collect skin’ equates to telling them to shut the f*ck up. The phrase allegedly originated from street vendors who would display their wares on wooden or cardboard mats, which they called pei (皮; skin). The act of packing up and clearing out when police arrive was therefore called ‘collecting skin’.", "", ""],

  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "se bo", "A metaphor for sloughing off all your responsibilities to someone else. The phrase is most commonly used to describe someone who fakes an illness and skips a day at the office in order to avoid work and responsibilities.", "", ""],
  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "fuk", "Literally meaning trap, this word is an adjective used to describe something that's of questionable or misleading quality, and thus likely to cause someone to fall into a 'trap'. A close English translation would be the word 'dodgy'.", "", ""],
  ["Localized English Phrases & Expressions", "keh ngauh wan mah", "This phrase describes the situation when a person is working one job but is actually on the lookout for something better at the same time. This saying can also be applied to relationships.", "", ""],
